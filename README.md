# sveltekit-dark-mode

Simple example showing dark mode theme toggle using SvelteKit + TailwindCSS

* Includes a simple icon toggle plus an animated switch toggle
* Smooth theme transition using a custom class so switch is less jarring
* Overrides system setting, once back to current system setting override is removed
* Will dynamically switch based on system preferences

Tip: Use the "Emulate CSS media feature prefers-color-scheme" in the "Rendering" tab of dev-tools to test different browser settings while testing without updating your Operating System config.
